The thing you need to know about the NOUN is that it starts VERB_ING on a whim. For proper care you will
need ADJECTIVE skills and one NOUN to be safe. Once your materials are ready, prepare to experience a violent 
sensation of VERB_ING with some ADJECTIVE side affects. You will also want to keep a bit of NOUN nearby
in case an ADJECTIVE incident occurs. And that is your intro to ANY_WORD 101. Good luck.
